BBQ is an art, a science, and—most importantly—a passion. While places like Texas, Kansas City, and the Carolinas get all the BBQ glory, I’ve always wondered: How does Colorado stack up?

This blog is my journey to find out. I’ll be exploring the best (and maybe the worst) that Colorado BBQ has to offer, comparing it to the legendary smokehouses of the South and Midwest. From brisket to burnt ends, ribs to pulled pork, I’ll be diving deep into the flavors, techniques, and traditions that make great BBQ what it is.

So whether you’re a die-hard pitmaster or just someone who loves a good plate of smoky, saucy goodness, stick around—because it’s time to see if Colorado’s BBQ game can compete with the best.

Let’s eat! 🍖🔥
